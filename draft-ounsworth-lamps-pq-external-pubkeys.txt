          External Keys For Use In Internet X.509 Certificates
            draft-ounsworth-lamps-pq-external-pubkeys-latest

Abstract

   Many of the post quantum cryptographic algorithms have large public
   keys.  In the interest of reducing bandwidth of transitting X.509
   certificates, this document defines new public key and algorithms for
   referencing external public key data by hash, and location, for
   example URL.  This mechanism is designed to mimic the behaviour of an
   Authority Information Access extension.

1.  Introduction

2.  External Value

   The id-external-value algorithm identifier is used for identifying a
   public key or signature which is provided as a reference to external
   data.

   id-external-value OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { iso(1)
               identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
               security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6)
               TBDOID }

   EDNOTE: for prototyping purposes, id-external-value ::=
   1.3.6.1.4.1.22554.4.2

   The corresponding subjectPublicKey is the DER encoding of the
   following structure:

   ExternalValue ::= SEQUENCE {
     location     GeneralNames,
     hashAlg      AlgorithmIdentifier,
     hashVal      OCTET STRING
   }

   Upon retrieval of the referenced data, the hash of the OCTET STRING
   of the retrieved data (removing base64 encoding as per [RFC4648] if
   necessary) MUST be verified using hashAlg to match the
   ExternalPublicKey.hash value.

   GeneralNames is defined in [RFC5280] as

   GeneralNames ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralName

   which we use instead of GeneralName so that certificate issuers can
   specify multiple backup key servers for high availability or specify
   key identifiers in multiple formats if the corresponding public keys
   will be distributed in multiple keystore formats.  When multiple key
   locations are specified, they MUST represent alternative locations
   for retrieval of the same key and MUST NOT be used as a mechanism to
   place multiple subject keys into a single certificate.  Thus, when
   multiple key locations are specified, the client MAY try them in any
   order and stop when it successfully retrieves a public key whose hash
   matches hashVal.

2.1.  External Public Key

   When used with a public key, algorithm parameters for id-external-
   value are absent.

   When ExternalValue is placed into a
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo.subjectPublicKey, the ExternalValue.location
   MUST refer to a DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo, which MAY be base64
   encoded as per [RFC4648] for easier transport over text protocols.

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no security implications to externalizing a public key from
   a certificate as described in this draft.  It is of course possible
   for a malicious actor to replace or tamper with the public key data
   at the referenced location, but since the hash of the public key data
   is included in the signed certificate, any such tampering will be
   detected and the certificate verification will fail.  For this
   reason, external public key data MAY be served over an insecure
   channel such as HTTP.

4.1.  CSRs and CT logs

   In practice, situations will arise where the
   ExternalPublicKey.location refers to a location which is not publicly
   available either because it is in a local keystore, on a private
   network, or no longer being hosted.

   Not having the public key in a certificate signing request (CSR)
   could make it substantially harder for CAs to perform vetting of the
   key, for example for cryptographic strength or checking for prior
   revocation due to key compromise.  A certificate requester MUST make
   the full public key available to the CA at the time of certificate
   request either by ensuring that the link in the
   ExternalPublicKey.location is visible to the CA, or by supplying the
   full public key to the CA out of band.

   Not having the public key in Certificate Transparency (CT) logs could
   make it substantially harder for researchers to perform auditing
   tasks on CT logs.  This may require additional CT mechanisms.

5.2.  Samples

   Here is a sample of a Kyber1024 end entity certificate with an
   external public key.  A trust anchor certificate using the algorithm
   ecdsaWithSHA256 is provided so that the Kyber1024 End Entity
   certificate can be verified.

   This is a modest example demonstrating a 550 byte Kyber1024
   certificate and a 2.2 kb external Kyber1024 public key.  This
   "compression" effect will be even more pronounced with algorithms
   such as Classic McEliece which have public keys in the hundreds of
   kilobytes; with the external public key mechanism, the size of the
   certificate remains constant regardless of how large the externalized
   subject public key is.

   End entity Kyber1024 Certificate with ExternalValue public key:

   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   MIIBbDCCARGgAwIBAgIGAYro4QFGMAoGCCqGSM49BAMCMDoxDjAMBgNVBAMMBVFT

   -----END CERTIFICATE-----

   For illustrative purposes, the SubjectPublicKeyInfo within the end
   entity certificate decodes as:

 subjectPublicKeyInfo SubjectPublicKeyInfo SEQUENCE (2 elem)
       algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier SEQUENCE (1 elem)
         algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER 1.3.6.1.4.1.22554.4.2 ExternalValue

   The external public key object referenced by the end entity
   certificate is:
